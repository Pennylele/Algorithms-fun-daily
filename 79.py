                # Penny: My feeling is that this is like hitting a brake. Since this is the DFS, so we traversal all the way to the leave (if possible), the "break" wouldn't work until we are returning to the previous stacks. In Example 3, we go all the way to [['#', '#', '#', 'E'], ['S', 'F', 'C', 'S'], ['A', 'D', 'E', 'E']], and then when coming back, we hit break every time we see a "#", cause res was True. So we return the them back to its original character which is stored in word[0]
